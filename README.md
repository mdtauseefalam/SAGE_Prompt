# SAGE Prompt
SAGE-Prompt (Semantic- Aware Graph Enhanced Prompting), a novel prompting technique that enriches LLM reasoning with structured semantic representations, including Control Flow Graphs (CFG), Call Graphs (CG), and Data Dependency (DD), represented as text for Solidity vulnerability detection.
The SAGE Prompt construction is done in three parts:
1. Graph Construction and Encoding
2. Example Retrieval
3. Merging and Prompt Construction

   Few of the files are planned to be uploaded in near future to replicate the research.
