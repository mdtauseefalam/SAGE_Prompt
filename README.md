# SAGE Prompt
SAGE-Prompt (Semantic- Aware Graph Enhanced Prompting), a novel prompting technique that enriches LLM reasoning with structured semantic representations, including Control Flow Graphs (CFG), Call Graphs (CG), and Data Dependency (DD), represented as text for Solidity vulnerability detection.
The SAGE Prompt construction is done in three parts:
1. Graph Construction and Encoding: The GaraphAnalyzer_Encoder.ipynb contains the code for graph construction and encode it into a form understandable by large language models.
2. Example Retrieval
3. Merging and Prompt Construction: The Merger.py contains the code for prompt construction. It formats and merges the files generated by "graph construction and encoding" stage and "example retrieval" along with target smart contract.

The folder "Prompts" contains all the prompts used for experiments in the paper. 

A sample SAGE-Prompt is depicted as "final_SAGE_Prompt.txt"

   Few of the files are planned to be uploaded in near future to replicate the research.
