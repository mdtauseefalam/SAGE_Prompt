You are an excellent smart contract vulnerability detector. 
Analyze the smart contract provided after [Solidity Code], written in Solidity.
Additional semantic context is included via its Control Flow Graph [CFG], Call Graph
[CG], and Data Dependency [DD]. Reference examples of similar vulnerabilities are
given under [<Vulnerability Type> Example] to support your reasoning. Determine:
(a) Is the contract vulnerable? (Yes or No) and (b) If yes, specify the vulnerability type (e.g.,
Reentrancy, Arithmetic, etc.)

Your Answer: {Vulnerability: ⟨Yes/No⟩, Vulnerability Type: ⟨Reentrancy/Arithmetic/...⟩}
